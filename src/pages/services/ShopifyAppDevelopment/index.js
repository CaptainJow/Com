                    <li>Understanding clients, project initiation and requirement analysis. <br />
                        Accurately fulfilling requirements is a must at Shams Software, which is why project requirements are thoroughly documented beforehand. 
                        Meetings are held together, and a process of discovery (to exchanging ideas and proposals) is initiated,
                        all with the aim of clarifying requirements before our professional design team can start prototyping.</li>
                    <li>Project Planning, Roadmap <br />
                        The focus is on planning the scope and controlling activities to see outcomes on schedule. We efficiently distribute the available resources, 
                        present the team makeup, and calculate the optimal plan to fit the budget and desired time constraints.
                        </li>
                    <li>Agile Development: <br/>
                        For Shopify App Development, we choose to adopt the agile method of development, because it enables timely testing of anticipated/sustainable outcomes.
                        At Shamssoftware, project managers and analysts constantly keep a vision on and regulate the openness of the development process and verify that the tasks are carried out correctly.
                        This all enables the client to manage adjustments and advancement processes.</li>
